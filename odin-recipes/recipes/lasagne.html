    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Real lasagne is such a treat - a celebratory dish to be shared 
        by many. Try my traditional bolognese version. It might look 
        like an epic recipe but it's not that daunting. The bolognese 
        and bechamel can be made a couple of days in advance and even 
        frozen, and the entire lasagne can be assembled the day before 
        and then baked on the day, making it perfect for a dinner 
        gathering.

    <ol>
        <li>Make the bolognese sauce and set aside. </li>
        <li>
            To make the white sauce, place the butter in a saucepan over 
            medium heat and allow to melt. Add the flour and stir to a 
            smooth paste. Whisk in the milk and then stir until the sauce 
            has boiled and thickened. Stir in the parmesan and add the 
            salt and pepper. Set aside to cool to room temperature. Preheat 
            the oven to 190°C (375°F). Grease a 20 cm (8 in) x 20 cm (8 in) 
            square ovenproof dish and line with some of the lasagne sheets.

            Thinly spread over quarter of the basic bolognese sauce, cover 
            with more lasagne sheets, then spoon over quarter of the white 
            sauce. Repeat the layers, finishing with the white sauce. 
            Sprinkle with the mozzarella and bake for 25–30 minutes or 
            until golden brown and cooked. Serve with a simple salad.
             Serves 4.
