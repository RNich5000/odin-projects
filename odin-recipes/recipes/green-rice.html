    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Cookie and Kate are finally back in the kitchen. I still wasn’t 
        feeling in the mood up until a couple of nights ago, when I spent 
        a few hours cleaning out the cabinets and the refrigerator. Turns 
        out, everyday cooking doesn’t need to involve avalanches of dried 
        pasta. Organization is key.
    </p>

    <p>
        The past few weeks of kitchen avoidance have been heavy with 
        introspection. I want to say that I’ve come out on the other 
        side with clarity and a renewed zest for life. (Every sad story 
        needs a happy ending, right?) The truth is, I’m still just one 
        sappy coffee shop love song away from another fit of tearful 
        existential despair.
    </p>

        <li>1 avocado, pitted and sliced</li>

        <li>Chopped coriander</li>
        <li>Crumbled feta</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit. Line one large, rimmed 
            baking sheet and one smaller sheet with parchment paper. Place 
            the spinach, cilantro, jalapeño, shallot, garlic, salt and ½ cup 
            of the vegetable broth in a food processor or blender. Blend 
            until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat until 
            shimmering. Add the rice and stir to coat. Spread the rice in an 
            even layer on the bottom of the pot and let the rice lightly 
            brown. This happens quickly! When the rice starts to brown, stir 
            it and spread it out in an even layer again so that more of the 
            rice browns.
        </li>
        <li>
            When most of the rice has lightly browned, scrape the green purée 
            into the rice. Stir until the rice is evenly coated with green 
            purée and continue to cook, stirring constantly, for a minute. 
            Add the rest of the vegetable broth to the pot. Bring to a boil, 
            then reduce the heat to a low simmer and cover the pot. Cook the 
            rice on a very low simmer until tender, 35 to 40 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the rice cooks, toss the sweet potatoes in the olive oil,
             smoked paprika and salt until the sweet potatoes are evenly 
             coated in oil. Arrange in a single layer on your prepared baking 
             sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, tossing halfway, until the 
             sweet potatoes are tender and caramelizing at the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, transfer the beans and their cooking liquid (don’t 
            drain the beans) to a medium pot. Stir in the cumin and chili 
            powder and warm over medium heat. Once the beans are simmering, 
            cover the beans and reduce heat to maintain a very gentle simmer 
            until you’re ready to serve.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the rice is done cooking, remove the pot from heat. Uncover 
            the pot and place a clean tea towel over the pot, then recover. 
            The towel will help absorb excess liquid as the rice continues 
            to cook in its own steam. (If you don’t have a clean towel, you 
            can skip this step, just cover normally.) Let sit for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Once the sweet potatoes are done cooking, toss the pepitas with 
            ¼ teaspoon olive oil and a sprinkle of salt on the small baking 
            sheet. Toast the seeds in the oven for 4 to 5 minutes, until 
            they’re turning lightly golden and making little popping noises. 
            Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Fluff the rice with a fork and season with salt if necessary. 
            Remove beans from heat, stir in the vinegar and season to taste 
            with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble your bowls: First add green rice, then use a slotted 
            spoon or fork to transfer beans to the bowls. Top with sweet 
            potatoes and add a few slices of avocado to each bowl. Sprinkle 
            with toasted pepitas and cilantro and optional feta. Serve with 
            salsa verde on the side.
        </li>
